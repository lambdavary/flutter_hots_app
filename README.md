# heroesofthestormapp

As a Heroes of the Strom player, this game will help me to follow heroes and their abilities.

## Getting Started

This project is written in Flutter by using Dart language.
It consumes Hots API to get the hero data and display them in list.
In addition, when clicked to a hero, detailed informaiton about hero is displayed like abilities and cooldowns.
